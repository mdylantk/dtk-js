# dtk-js
My java script experiments.

The current state do not offer much and consist of simple elements for working with canvas. 

Note on files:
-CanasGNGin.js contain an object to simplify drawing on canvas. It may need to be init before it works and is a wip.
-DTKStorage.js handles elements drawn on the canvas and works with CanasGNGin(what to draw every tick and soon determain collsion and layers). It is a wip.
InputHandler.js is what I am using for holding inputs. it is a wip
Main.js is that init the other three and get everything working right.

TextIndext.html is a testing file for above. 

DTKSlideshow.js is a stand alone image slide show.

current todo list:
-add colision methods
-design basic object template
-add more checks for nulls
-add a core object for either a game, web use or both
